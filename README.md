## Next on the "to do" list of to-do project:
0. Clean up to-do-creator code and add it's style
1. Only one element can be edited at given time (sort of done with 'blur' listener, but needs more work)
2. Better way of adding new elements (in work)
3. Even "cleaner" way of looking
4. Clean up code (XD)
