## Next on the "to do" list of to-do project:
1. Only one element can be edited at given time (sort of done with 'blur' listener, but needs more work)
2. Better way of adding new elements
3. Even "cleaner" way of looking
4. Can't change priority of empty elements
5. Allow copying text, atm it just gets dragged
